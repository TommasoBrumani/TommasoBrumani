<b>My Accomplishments:</b>
<p>

üíº <b>Work Experience:</b>

* `Machine Learning Engineer - Master's Thesis Worker` @ [`Ericsson`](https://www.ericsson.com/) : developed a microservices-based autonomous anomaly detection system for time series data. Performed data cleaning and processing operations for large numbers of time series, selected and trained anomaly detection models based on machine learning, and designed a pipeline for the continuous operation of the system.
  
* `Backend Developer` @ [`SorintLab`](https://www.sorint.com/) : worked for 1 year as a part-time developer, maintainer, and pipeline administrator on an internal application for reserving office spaces in various offices worldwide. 

üî® <b>Most Interesting Projects:</b>

* [`Complex Networks Exercises`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/complex-networks-exercises) : a series of exercises on the topic of complex networks, exploring various kinds of network analysis algorithms and operations. Assignment for a Complex Networks course.
* [`Reinforcement Learning Exercises`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/reinforcement-learning-exercises) : a series of exercises implementing various kinds of reinforcement learning algorithms. Assignment for a Reinforcement Learning Course.
* [`ANN for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/multivariate-time-series-forecasting) : a deep learning model used to predict a multivariate time series. Group assignment for an Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
* [`ANN for Leaf Image Classification`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/leaf-classificator) : a deep learning model used to classify images of leaves. Group assignment for an Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
* [`Recommender System for Movie Recommendations`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/movie-recommender-system) : a repository containing multiple versions of hybrid recommender models to optimize the recommendation of movies to specific users. Base recommender models were already provided. Group assignment for a Recommender Systems course.
* [`Telcom Service Company Online Store`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/telcom-services-online-store) : a website for the sale of telecommunication service packages using persistence and triggers. Front-end is bare-bones as the focus was on the backend and database implementation. Group Assignment for a Data Bases course.
* [`Masters of the Reinassance Digital Board Game`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/ingswAM2021-Alesani-Brumani-Cagliani) : a digital implementation of the "Masters of the Renaissance" board game, complete with CLI and GUI interfaces, single-player mode, remote play up to 4 players, and auto-saving. Group assignment for a Software Engineering course.
* [`edU CLI editor`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/edU-CLI-text-editor) : a simplified command line text editor capable of adding, editing, or deleting rows from a text, complete with 'undo' and 'redo' functions. Was created attempting to optimize memory usage and speed under various circumstances. Assignment for a Algorithms and Computer Science Principles course.

üå± <b>Hobbies:</b>

* ü•ã Martial Arts (currently Krav Maga)
* üéπ Playing Music (currently Piano, but learning Guitar!)
* üñäÔ∏è Drawing (mostly digitally)
* üé¨ Narrative Media (Videogames, Books, Movies, TV Series, you name it!)
