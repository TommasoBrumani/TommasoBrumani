<b>My Accomplishments:</b>
<p>

üíº <b>Work Experience:</b>

* `Machine Learning Engineer` @ [`Ericsson`](https://www.ericsson.com/) : developed a microservices-based anomaly detection system for time series data in `Python`. Engineered a scalable time series processing pipeline for large quantities of time series data using `PySpark`. Created an autonomous training process for machine learning anomaly detection models, using data and model versioning. Designed the continuous operation of the full system as a collaboration of three microservices, dedicated to data processing, model training, and anomaly detection, respectively.
  
* `Backend Developer` @ [`SorintLab`](https://www.sorint.com/) : developed the backend of a cloud-native, internal web application used by company employees to reserve office spaces in various locations worldwide. Managed and migrated the application's CI/CD pipeline, initially using `Jenkins` and, later, using an internal DevOps platform. Created extensive, automated unit and integration testing for the application's backend and database, and integrated them with the CI/CD pipeline.

üî® <b>Most Interesting Public Projects:</b>

* [`ANN for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/multivariate-time-series-forecasting) : a deep learning model used to predict a multivariate time series. Group assignment for an Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
* [`ANN for Leaf Image Classification`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/leaf-classificator) : a deep learning model used to classify images of leaves. Group assignment for an Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.
* [`Masters of the Reinassance Digital Board Game`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/ingswAM2021-Alesani-Brumani-Cagliani) : a digital implementation of the "Masters of the Renaissance" board game, complete with CLI and GUI interfaces, single-player mode, remote play up to 4 players, and auto-saving. Group assignment for a Software Engineering course.
* [`Recommender System for Movie Recommendations`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/movie-recommender-system) : a repository containing multiple versions of hybrid recommender models to optimize the recommendation of movies to specific users. Base recommender models were already provided. Group assignment for a Recommender Systems course.
* [`Telcom Service Company Online Store`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/telcom-services-online-store) : a website for the sale of telecommunication service packages using persistence and triggers. Front-end is bare-bones as the focus was on the backend and database implementation. Group Assignment for a Data Bases course.
* [`edU CLI editor`](https://github.com/TommasoBrumani/edU-CLI-text-editor) : a simplified command line text editor capable of adding, editing, or deleting rows from a text, complete with 'undo' and 'redo' functions. Was created attempting to optimize memory usage and speed under various circumstances. Assignment for a Algorithms and Computer Science Principles course.

üå± <b>Hobbies:</b>
