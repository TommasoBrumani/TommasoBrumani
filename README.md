<b>About Me:</b>

<p>

👱‍♂️ I'm <b>Tommaso Brumani</b>, a `Machine Learning Engineer` with a background in `Data Science` and `Software Engineering`, who has a deep interest in MLOps and the practical application of Artificial Intelligence to real-world business problems.

📚 I am currently working as a ML Engineer at `Microsoft`, where I support Data Scientist by designing and implementing the MLOps infrastructure surrounding their models, automating the cumbersome steps of the model training and deployment process.
